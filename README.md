# DiSSCo Knowledge base
As an initiative formed by public research institutions, DiSSCo is committed to Open Science. We believe that Open Science not only makes the scientific work more transparent and accessible but also enables a whole new set of collaborative and IT-based scientific methods. This means that the outputs of our common research projects are openly available at the **DiSSCo Knowledge base**.

The first Beta version is now availabe at [know.dissco.eu](https://know.dissco.eu/)!  

We would like to ask you to help us to improve and test the DiSSCo Knowlegde base, and use this place for feedback and suggestions. Please use the [GitHub issues](https://github.com/DiSSCo/kb/issues) section in this repo for you public feedback.

 For content that should be in the Knowledgebase and is not yet uploaded, please use the specific issue:  [Content for the Knowledgebase](https://github.com/DiSSCo/kb/issues/27).
